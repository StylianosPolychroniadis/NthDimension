Mar-16-2020	-Added to NthDimension.Algebra.Quaternion the functions 
				public static Vector3 GetRotationEuler(ref Quaternion q)
			-Added to NthDimension.Algebra.Quaterniond the functions
				public static Vector3d GetRotationEuler(ref Quaterniond q)
			-Disabled code (un-comment all once to restore) in NthDimension.Procedural.City.Density
															   NthDimension.Procedural.City.Crossing
			-De-coupling NthDimension.Rendering.ApplicationUser from ViewControllers. Now I have to
			 modify NthDimension.ApplicationUser (FirstPersonView & ThirdPersonView) to be universally 
			 used
			-Created NthDimension.Rendering.Scenegraph.SceneGame_Navigation 
				TODO:: Implement proper colliders and pass to ApplicationUser controllers accordingly (ie by heightFunction<> ?)
			-Modified Terrain.cs Added function public float GetHeightAt(float x, float z). I had to make global these vars:
				 //int wide = 0, tall = 0;
                 //byte[] imagePixels = null;
			-Some progress on TerrainShape for NavigationMesh but only for 1st person view
			-Added Scene.PhysicsSettings
Mar-17-2020 -Added NthDimension.FFMpeg.VideoSource consoleDebug, swithed in the Ctor.
			 Added NthDimension.FFMpeg.VideoGL3x.Read and ReadFolder #if DEBUG clauses
			 This is to eliminate weird bugs when app launches with no focus
			-Trying to figure out TerrainShape ScaleX and ScaleY SceneGame.Navigation
			 i)  Looks like this value matches subdivisions when set to 1f
			 ii) Terrain Shape starts at 0,0 and expands to whatever I set to Scale(?). Need to
			     find a way to set its center to 0,0 
			 iii) No success yet
